/** \page install Installation


\section getting-the-code Getting the code                

First the ergoPack repository should be cloned using [git].
To do so:
1. Change directory to where you want to clone the repository $GITDIR:

        cd $GITDIR
     
2. Clone the ergoPack repository (git should be installed):

        git clone https://github.com/atantet/ergoPack


\section dependencies Dependencies          

Mandatory libraries:
- [GSL] is used as the main C scientific library.
An updated version is used which includes an extension of the sparse module
not (yet) implemented in the official distribution (see \ref installing-the-code).

Specific libraries:
- [ARPACK++] is an object-oriented version of the ARPACK package
used to calculate the spectrum of sparse matrices in atspectrum.hpp.
- [OpenMP][OMP] is used for multi-threading by transferOperator.hpp
when WITH_OMP is set to 1 when compiling.


\section installing-the-code Installing the code                

1. Create a directory ergoPack/ in your favorite include directory $INCLUDE:

        mkdir $INCLUDE/ergoPack
     
2. Copy the ergoPack/*.hpp source files to $INCLUDE/ergoPack/:

        cd $GITDIR/ergoPack
        cp *.hpp $INCLUDE/ergoPack
     
3. Include these files in your C++ codes. For example, in order to include the matrix manipulation functions in atmatrix.hpp,
add in your C++ file:

        #include <ergoPack/atmatrix.hpp>
    

\section updating-the-code Updating the code              

1. Pull the ergoPack repository:

        cd $GITDIR/ergoPack     
        git pull
     
2. Copy the source files to your favorite include directory $INCLUDE:

        cp *.hpp $INCLUDE/ergoPack


\section compiling Compiling                   

\subsection without-omp Without OpenMP               

If INCLUDE is not a system directory such as /usr/include/ or /usr/local/include/
then either it should be added to CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH or at compilation using -I$INCLUDE. E.g.

     g++ -c -I$INCLUDE source.cpp

When linking, GSL should be linked by added -lgsl.
If GSL's directory is not a system one or in LIBRARY_PATH then -L$GSLDIR should be added. E.g.

     g++ -L$GSLDIR source.o -lgsl
     
\subsection with-omp With OpenMP                  

If OpenMP is to be used, then WITH_OMP should be set to 1,
-fopenmp -DWITH_OMP=$WITH_OMP used when compiling
and -lgomp when linking.

     g++ -c -fopenmp -DWITH_OMP=$WITH_OMP -I$INCLUDE source.cpp
     g++ -L$GSLDIR source.o -lgsl -lgomp
