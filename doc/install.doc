\section installing-the-code Downloading and installing ergoPack

First the ergoPack repository should be cloned using [git].
To do so, clone the ergoPack repository to some directory $GITDIR
(git should be installed using your favorite package manager):

    cd $GITDIR
    git clone https://github.com/atantet/ergoPack
    
Then, compile the library:

    make

Finally, install the include files and library in directories $PREFIX/include and $PREFIX/lib:

    make install
 
One can set the variable PREFIX in the Makefile.

\section updating-the-code Updating the code              

Pull the ergoPack repository:

    cd $GITDIR/ergoPack     
    git pull

Then, make and make install as in \ref installing-the-code.

\section dependencies Dependencies          

- [GSL] is used as the main C scientific library.
As of now, the last development version of GSL is necessary,
as it includes a required extension of its sparse module.
The git repository is cloned to your local directory by running:

    cd $GITDIR
    git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gsl.git
The library can then be installed using the usual Unix tools:

    cd $GITDIR/gsl/
    ./configure [--prefix=...]
    make
    make install
    
- [ARPACK++] is an object-oriented version of the ARPACK package
used to calculate the spectrum of sparse matrices in transferSpectrum.hpp.
It can be downloaded from the maintained repository [arpackpp] and installed
by copying the source files to your include directory $INCLUDE:

    cd $GITDIR
    git clone https://github.com/m-reuter/arpackpp
    cp arpackpp/include/* $INCLUDE/
    
[ARPACK++] depends at least on [BLAS] and [ARPACK]. If not installed yet,
they can be compiled from the [arpackpp] directory
and installed to your library directory $LIB:

    cd $GITDIR/arpackpp/
    ./install-openblas.sh
    ./install-arpack-ng.sh
    cp external/*.a $LIB/
    
- [libconfig] is used in the examples to parse configuration files playing
the role of Fortran's namelists.
It is not required if the user uses her/his own configuration strategy.
To download from the git repository and install:

    cd $GITDIR
    git clone https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig
    cd $GITDIR/libconfig
    ./configure [--prefix=...]
    make
    make install
    
- [OpenMP][OMP] is the optional multi-threading standard used by transferOperator.hpp
when WITH_OMP=1 at compilation. It is integrated in most modern compilers such as gcc.


\section compiling Compiling                   

\subsection without-omp Without OpenMP               

Include the ergoPack headers in your C++ codes. For example,
in order to include the transfer operator header transferOperator.hpp, add in your C++ file:

    #include <transferOperator.hpp>
    
If $INCLUDE is not a system directory such as /usr/include/ or /usr/local/include/
then either it should be added to CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH or at compilation using -I$INCLUDE. E.g.

    g++ -c -I$INCLUDE source.cpp

When linking, the ergoPack library libergopack.a should be linked
together [GSL] library. This is done by adding -lergopack -lgsl to the linking command. 
If ergoPack and [GSL]'s directories are not a system one or in LIBRARY_PATH then -L$ERGOPACK -L$GSLDIR should be added
with ERGOPACK="/path/to/libergopack.a" and GSLDIR="/path/to/gsl/libgsl.a.
[BLAS] and [ARPACK] should be linked when using ARPACK++ in transferSpectrum.hpp by adding -lopenblas -larpack.
If [libconfig] is used for parsing, it should also be linked by adding -lconfig++.
For example:

    g++ -L$GSLDIR source.o -lgsl -lconfig++ -lopenblas -larpack
Note that an appropriate Makefile is provided in each example directory.
     
\subsection with-omp With OpenMP                  

If OpenMP is to be used, then WITH_OMP should be set to 1,
-fopenmp -DWITH_OMP=$WITH_OMP used when compiling
and -lgomp when linking.

    g++ -c -fopenmp -DWITH_OMP=$WITH_OMP -I$INCLUDE source.cpp
    g++ -L$GSLDIR source.o  -lgsl -lconfig++ -lopenblas -larpack -lgomp
