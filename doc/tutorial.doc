The main purpose of ergoPack is to study the mixing properties
of high-dimensional (random) dynamical systems
in terms of the spectrum of reduced transfer operators.
However, it also includes modules to generate time series of typical systems
such as normal forms of codimension one bifurcations,
low-dimensional chaotic flows, stochastic processes and delayed systems.
These time series can then be used to estimate tranfer operators
as in the present tutorial.

\section tutoSimulating Simulating

ergoPack includes three headers to generate time series
of ordinary, stochastic and delay differential equations:
- ODESolvers.hpp: for the integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
Also includes some base clases used by the other headers.
- SDESolvers.hpp: for the integration of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs).
- SDDESolvers.hpp: for the integration of (Stochastic) Delay Differential Equations (SDDEs).

These headers use C++ polymorphism making them as modular as possible.
To integrate a given system, one defines a model with a vector field for the drift
(possibly including delays), a stochastic vector field for the diffusion
and a finite-difference numerical scheme.
